# After Effects Particle Automation

This project helps automate the creation and management of particle and null layers in Adobe After Effects using both internal and external JavaScript scripting. It tracks where scripts are located, their purposes, and provides a feature-driven project plan for organized development.

## Structure

- `internal_scripts/` — Scripts and expressions embedded within the AE project (with notes on their comp/layer locations)
- `external_scripts/` — Scripts run outside AE (e.g., ExtendScript, Node.js automation)
- `project_plan.md` — High-level plan and feature tracking
- `script_registry.md` — Log of all scripts, locations, and purposes

## Workflow

1. Use the project plan to implement features one at a time.
2. Register every script (internal/external) in `script_registry.md`.
3. Update documentation as features and scripts evolve.

## Getting Started

- Place internal scripts/expressions in `internal_scripts/` and note their AE locations.
- Place external scripts in `external_scripts/`.
- Update `project_plan.md` and `script_registry.md` as you work.
